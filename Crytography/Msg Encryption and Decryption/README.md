# 🔐 RSA Implementation in Python

This is a **pure Python** implementation of the RSA encryption and decryption algorithm. It includes key generation, message encryption, and decryption using small prime numbers (for demo purposes only).

## 📂 Files
- `rsa-implementation.py`: Main script containing RSA logic and example usage.

## 🛠 Features
- Generates public and private key pairs
- Encrypts and decrypts text messages
- Demonstrates RSA math step-by-step
- No external libraries needed

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
python rsa-implementation.py
```

## 📦 Sample Output

```
RSA Encryption/Decryption Demo
Public key: (65537, 3233)
Private key: (2753, 3233)

Original Message: hello
Encrypted: [some integers]
Decrypted: hello
```

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This script uses small primes and is intended **for learning only**. Do not use it in production or real-world secure communication.
